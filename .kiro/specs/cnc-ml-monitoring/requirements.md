# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a machine learning application backend designed for Industry 4.0 CNC machine monitoring and analysis. The system will provide REST API endpoints for data ingestion, machine learning model training, and predictive analytics using downtime metrics from CNC machines. The application will connect to a MySQL database hosted on Railway and provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities for manufacturing operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Integration and Data Management

**User Story:** As a manufacturing engineer, I want the system to connect to our MySQL database on Railway, so that I can access real-time and historical CNC machine data for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection to the MySQL database hosted on Railway using the joblog_ob table
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and provide fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN querying machine data THEN the system SHALL retrieve records from the joblog_ob table with all required columns: machine, StartTime, EndTime, JobNumber, State, PartNumber, EmpID, OperatorName, OpNumber, PartsProduced, JobDuration, RunningTime, and all downtime metrics
4. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and efficient querying for the ~10,000 records
5. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and handle missing or invalid values appropriately

### Requirement 2: FastAPI REST API Framework

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want a well-structured FastAPI application with organized endpoints, so that I can easily integrate with existing manufacturing systems and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is structured THEN the system SHALL organize code into logical folders (models, services, repositories, API routes)
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful conventions and include proper HTTP status codes
3. WHEN requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper request/response validation using Pydantic models
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes
5. WHEN the API is accessed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive API documentation via FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation
6. WHEN developing endpoints THEN the system SHALL implement one endpoint at a time with proper testing before moving forward

### Requirement 3: Machine Learning Training and Analytics

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to train machine learning models on CNC machine downtime data, so that I can predict maintenance needs and optimize production efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL use the downtime reason columns: SetupTime, WaitingSetupTime, NotFeedingTime, AdjustmentTime, DressingTime, ToolingTime, EngineeringTime, MaintenanceTime, BuyInTime, BreakShiftChangeTime, IdleTime
2. WHEN processing data for ML THEN the system SHALL implement feature engineering for time-based patterns and machine performance metrics
3. WHEN training occurs THEN the system SHALL support multiple ML algorithms suitable for time series and classification tasks
4. WHEN models are trained THEN the system SHALL evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques
5. WHEN predictions are made THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and model interpretability features
6. WHEN model artifacts are created THEN the system SHALL implement model versioning and storage mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Downtime Analysis and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a production manager, I want to analyze machine downtime patterns and receive insights, so that I can make informed decisions about maintenance scheduling and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing downtime THEN the system SHALL calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) including Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), availability, performance, and quality metrics
2. WHEN processing time data THEN the system SHALL handle different time zones and date formats correctly
3. WHEN calculating metrics THEN the system SHALL aggregate data by machine, operator, job, and time periods
4. WHEN identifying patterns THEN the system SHALL detect anomalies in machine performance and downtime reasons
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide statistical summaries and trend analysis for each downtime category

### Requirement 5: API Endpoints for Data Access and ML Operations

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want specific API endpoints for different operations, so that I can build client applications and integrate with other systems efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing machine data THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for retrieving machine records with filtering and pagination
2. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to initiate training jobs and monitor training progress
3. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for real-time and batch prediction requests
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for retrieving KPIs and downtime analytics
5. WHEN managing models THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for model deployment, versioning, and performance monitoring
6. WHEN testing endpoints THEN each endpoint SHALL be thoroughly tested before implementing the next one

### Requirement 6: Data Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust data validation and error handling, so that the system remains stable and provides clear feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving API requests THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters and data formats
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
3. WHEN ML operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and recovery suggestions
4. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings and implement data cleaning strategies
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting and resource management

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the application to handle concurrent requests and large datasets efficiently, so that it can scale with our growing manufacturing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL implement async/await patterns for database and ML operations
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement streaming and batch processing capabilities
3. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage and provide progress tracking
4. WHEN serving predictions THEN the system SHALL implement caching mechanisms for frequently requested data
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL include logging and metrics collection for system optimization
