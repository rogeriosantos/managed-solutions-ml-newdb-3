# Setup Notes

## Database Configuration

The application is configured to connect to your Railway MySQL database with the following details:
- **Host**: gondola.proxy.rlwy.net
- **Port**: 21632
- **Database**: railway
- **User**: root

### Required Action

**You need to update the database password in the `.env` file:**

1. Open the `.env` file
2. Replace `your_password` in the `DATABASE_URL` and `DB_PASSWORD` fields with your actual Railway database password
3. Save the file

### Testing the Connection

After setting the password, you can test the database connection:

```bash
python test_db_connection.py
```

This will verify:
- ✅ Database connection works
- ✅ The `joblog_ob` table exists
- ✅ Show record count and table structure

### Starting the Application

Once the database is configured, start the application:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The application will be available at:
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health

## Project Structure Completed

✅ **Task 1 Complete**: Set up project structure and core configuration

The following has been implemented:
- Complete directory structure for models, services, repositories, API components
- FastAPI application entry point with basic configuration
- Environment variables and settings management using Pydantic
- Requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- Database configuration with Railway MySQL support
- Basic health check and root endpoints
- Comprehensive documentation and setup instructions

**Next Steps**: The project is ready for Task 2 (Database models and configuration).
